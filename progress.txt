# Emoji Picker React → Emoji Picker Solid Migration Progress

## Completed
- Updated README.md to reflect Solid.js instead of React.js
- Created progress.txt file
- Examined project structure to understand the codebase
- Created Solid.js project configuration
  - Updated package.json for Solid.js
  - Updated tsconfig.json for Solid.js
  - Created vite.config.js for build configuration
  - Created vitest.setup.js for test configuration
- Started porting core components
  - ErrorBoundary
  - Main EmojiPicker wrapper
  - EmojiPickerSolid component

## In Progress
- Porting React components to Solid.js components
  - Working through TypeScript errors
  - Need to implement custom hooks as Solid.js primitives

## Current Status
We've attempted to run the tests, but encountered numerous TypeScript errors (94 errors in 33 files). These need to be fixed before tests can run successfully.

The main issues are:
1. React JSX vs Solid JSX differences (`className` vs `class`)
2. React Context API vs Solid Context API
3. Different method signatures between React refs and Solid refs
4. Handling of children props differs between React and Solid
5. React's event handling vs Solid's event handling

## Next Steps
1. Methodically fix TypeScript errors in the core structure first:
   - Fix `className` to `class` across all components
   - Fix Context providers and consumers to use Solid's API
   - Update all import statements from React to Solid

2. Port components in this order:
   - Layout components (Absolute, Relative, Flex)
   - Basic UI components (Button, etc.)
   - Main PickerMain component
   - Context providers
   - Header, body, and footer components
   - Emoji rendering components
   - Custom hooks as Solid primitives

3. Add basic tests for ported components to ensure functionality

## Blocking Issues
- TypeScript errors due to differences between React and Solid JSX types
- Need to create proper Solid.js equivalents for React hooks
- Significant refactoring needed for many components due to different rendering models

## Project Analysis
The project is structured as follows:
- `src/` - Main source code
  - Contains 95 files that need to be ported
  - `EmojiPickerReact.tsx` - Main component
  - `index.tsx` - Exports and main entry point
  - `components/` - Various UI components
  - `hooks/` - React hooks for various functionality
  - `config/` - Configuration related code
  - `data/` - Data files
  - `Stylesheet/` - Styling utilities
  - `types/` - TypeScript types

### Testing
- The test directory contains a single empty file (`test/test.ts`)
- The original project uses tsdx for testing
- Our port uses vitest for testing
- We need to create actual tests as we port the components

## Migration Strategy
1. ✅ Set up initial Solid.js project structure based on vite-template-solid
2. ✅ Port the ErrorBoundary component to Solid's createEffect and error handling
3. Start porting context providers to Solid's createContext
4. Port React hooks to Solid's reactive primitives
5. Port the main EmojiPicker component
6. Implement tests for each component as we port them
7. Focus on one component at a time, fixing TypeScript errors methodically

## Migration Notes
Key React to Solid migrations:
- Replace `className` with `class`
- Replace `useState` with `createSignal`
- Replace `useEffect` with `createEffect`
- Replace `useRef` with `createRef`
- Replace `useMemo` with `createMemo`
- Replace `useCallback` with regular functions
- Replace React's context with Solid's context API
- Replace React's children prop with Solid's children API
- JSX in Solid is typed differently and more strictly

React hooks have direct equivalents in Solid:
| React                | Solid                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| useState             | createSignal          |
| useEffect            | createEffect          |
| useLayoutEffect      | createRenderEffect    |
| useMemo              | createMemo            |
| useRef               | createRef             |
| useContext           | useContext            |
| useReducer           | createReducer (custom)|
| useCallback          | No direct equivalent  |
| useImperativeHandle  | No direct equivalent  |

Different rendering models:
- React uses virtual DOM
- Solid uses fine-grained reactivity without re-rendering components
